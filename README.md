# TicTacToeAI
A very simple reinforcement-learning AI for tic-tac-toe. 

Featuring:
- an implementation of N x N tic-tac-toe
- a playable interface
- a "matchstick"-type reinforcement algorithm
- training against a random opponent and/or a human
- non-optimized weights
- better-than-random performance
- no symmetry optimizations (yet)
- no hard-coded strategies

This project was written up in about 5 hours a pleasant summer day 2021 with spontaneous inspiration.
I had no prior knowledge of any type of AI, why it is far from optimal.
